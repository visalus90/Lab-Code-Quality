- What Is Code Quality?
    - Quality code is "subjective and open to argument"
    - Not very important code vs. very important code, both have to be free of errors and are important
    - Other properties that contribute to quality code include maintainability, clarity, testability, portability, and more
- Benefits of Code Quality
    - Technical and Cultural both play a role in long-lasting quality code
        - This contributes to the success and longevity of code being used in future projects
    -  Product Confidence & Reputation
        - Quality code performs to exceed customer expectations, invoking trust and stopping individuals from going elsewhere
    - Promotes Reuse
        - If code portability was written in mind, it could cut future costs including Development and testing
    - Diminishes Technical Debt
        - Quality code reduces future costs that accrue from rework 
        - If quality code is left out more money would be used during the software development lifecycle
        - The highest technical debt usually happens once a is released. Balancing quality code and release time is important
    - Increases Product Longevity
        - Good code well designed and executed allows for quick enhancements, allowing for new capabilities and features
        - Opportunities for more revenue gains
        - Code quality contributes to maintainability and labor costs
- Code Quality Best Practices
    - Code/Peer Reviews
        - Collaborating with peers' has been shown to improve code quality
    - Code Robustness
        - Quality code can handle good and bad times. To help, negative testing helps promote creativity and prevent incomplete data
    - Use or Write Code That's Safe
        - For important applications apply coding standards to identify unsafe code to prevent bad outcomes
    - Use or Write Code That's Secure
        - For applications that need to be secure, apply coding standards that show vulnerabilities to protect against attack
