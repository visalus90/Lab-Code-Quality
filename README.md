- What Is Code Quality?
    - Quality code is "subjective and open to argument"
    - Not very important code vs. very important code, both have to be free of errors and are important
    - Other properties that contribute to quality code include maintainability, clarity, testability, portability, and more
- Benefits of Code Quality
    - Technical and Cultural both play a role in long-lasting quality code
        - This contributes to the success and longevity of code being used in future projects
    -  Product Confidence & Reputation
        - Quality code performs to exceed customer expectations, invoking trust and stopping individuals from going elsewhere
    - Promotes Reuse
        - If code portability was written in mind, it could cut future costs including Development and testing
    - Diminishes Technical Debt
        - Quality code reduces future costs that accrue from rework 
        - If quality code is left out more money would be used during the software development lifecycle
        - The highest technical debt usually happens once a is released. Balancing quality code and release time is important
    - Increases Product Longevity
        - Good code well designed and executed allows for quick enhancements, allowing for new capabilities and features
        - Opportunities for more revenue gains
        - Code quality contributes to maintainability and labor costs
- Code Quality Best Practices
    - Code/Peer Reviews
        - Collaborating with peers' has been shown to improve code quality
    - Code Robustness
        - Quality code can handle good and bad times. To help, negative testing helps promote creativity and prevent incomplete data
    - Use or Write Code That's Safe
        - For important applications apply coding standards to identify unsafe code to prevent bad outcomes
    - Use or Write Code That's Secure
        - For applications that need to be secure, apply coding standards that show vulnerabilities to protect against attack
    - Code Clarity
        - Writer code is a way that can be read and understood. Complicated code is unproductive and makes it hard to find bugs, costly, and effects maintenance
    - Code Complexity
        - Complicated and complex code leads to bugs and can affect other code functions, which affects readability, reliability, and maintenance
    - Code Portability
        - Writing code with portability in mind makes it easier to use other platforms and operating systems. This can save both time and cost
    - Code Reusability
        - Well-written code is easier to reuse in the future with products or projects. This helps with workflow, labor, and testing costs

- How do you ensure your code is quality and functional?
    - Writing code isn't enough to have a successful product
        - Code quality should be functional. It should meet the requirements and standards
- Use a style guide
    - Set of rules and protocols define how code should look and function
        - This usually covers aspects such as formatting, comments, records, and more. Using style guides helps keep things organized, easily read, and understood by others
- Write tests
    - Tests make sure your code is functional and meets requirements
        - It helps find and fix errors, restructure code without breaking it, and improves code quality
- Use code analysis tools
    - Used to help find bugs, security issues, and duplications
        - This will improve code quality by providing feedback, suggestions, and performance improvements. It can also force the use of style guides in your code
- Do code reviews
    - Review your code by yourself or someone else, before merging your code
        - Doing this improves code quality and finds errors, bugs, improvements, and more. Doing this allows for a change in knowledge and improves collaboration
- Use debugging tools
    - Tools used to find and fix errors, and test functionality, behavior, and output
- Refactor your code
    - Helps improve your code building blocks, look, and readability without changing its function

- Clean Code in PHP: Best Practices and Principles
    - Quality code is the foundation of development. Understanding quality code makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
        - PHP developers should write clean code to limit debt, foster collaboration, and improve quality
- Principle 1: Code should be easy to read
    - Code is often read more than written. Simple code makes it easier to read and reduces errors
- Principle 2: Code should be DRY
    - Dry stands for "Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself"
        - If code is being reused, refactor the code into a reusable function or class. This will reduce errors and make code easier to maintain
- Principle 3: Code should be modular
    - Clean code should be broken down into modular form
        - Modular form code has a single use and acts alone. Modular code is easier to read, test, and maintain
- Principle 4: Code should be efficient
    - Code shouldn't be all about speed and performance
        - Understanding PHP code understanding the cost, unneeded calculations, and the right data. Don't optimize till proven
- Principle 5: Code should be robust and handle errors gracefully
    - Good code that can handle the unexpected without crashing, involves checking inputs, exceptions properly, and useful error messages
- Principle 6: Code should be testable
    - Code should be designed to be easily tested. This means having clear inputs and outputs, avoiding hidden dependencies, and doing one thing well
- Principle 7: Code should follow a coding standard
    - Code should follow standards and style guides. Consistent and easy-to-read code helps prevent errors
        - PHP usually follows PSR-2 standards following indentation, spacing, and naming conventions
- Principle 8: Code should be well-documented
    - Comments and documentation are just as important as good coding.
        - Should explain why and not what was done. PHPDoc program can be used to provide documentation
